    "achieving this is to place a web backdoor or web shell within the web",

    "cyber-criminals will attempt to locate these web backdoors or shells", 
    "by requesting the names of the most common and well known ones.\n\nBy", 
    "analysing the response, they are able to determine if a web backdoor", 
    "or web shell exists. These web backdoors or web shells can then",

    "A modern web application will be reliant on several different", 
    "programming languages.\n\nThese languages can be broken up in two", 
    "flavours. These are client-side languages (such as those that run in", 
    "the browser -- like JavaScript) and server-side languages (which are", 
    "executed by the server -- like ASP, PHP, JSP, etc.) to form the", 
    "dynamic pages (client-side code) that are then sent to the client.", 
    "Because all server-side code should be executed by the server, it", 
    "should only ever come from a trusted source.\n\nCode injection occurs", 
    "when the server takes untrusted code (ie. from the client) and", 
    "executes it.\n\nCyber-criminals will abuse this weakness to execute", 
    "arbitrary code on the server, which could result in complete server", 
    "compromise."

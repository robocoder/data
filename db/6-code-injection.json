    "A modern web application will be reliant on several different", 
    "programming languages.\n\nThese languages can be broken up in two", 
    "flavours. These are client-side languages (such as those that run in", 
    "the browser -- like JavaScript) and server-side languages (which are", 
    "executed by the server -- like ASP, PHP, JSP, etc.) to form the", 
    "dynamic pages (client-side code) that are then sent to the client.", 
    "Because all server-side code should be executed by the server, it", 
    "should only ever come from a trusted source.\n\nCode injection occurs", 
    "when the server takes untrusted code (ie. from the client) and", 
    "executes it.\n\nCyber-criminals will abuse this weakness to execute", 
    "arbitrary code on the server, which could result in complete server", 
    "compromise.\n\nThe tool was able to inject specific server-side code and", 
    "have the executed output from the code contained within the server", 
    "response. This indicates that proper input sanitisation is not", 
    "occurring."

      "server-side code.\n\nTo validate input, the application should ensure", 
      "that the supplied value contains only the data that are required to", 
      "perform the relevant action.\n\nFor example, where a username is", 
      "required, then no non-alpha characters should not be accepted."

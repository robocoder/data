    "A NoSQL injection occurs when a value originating from the client's", 
    "request is used within a NoSQL call without prior sanitisation.\n\nThis",

    "steal data, or use the additional functionality of the database server", 
    "to take control of further server components.\n\nThe tool discovered that",

    "detected as the tool was able to discover known error messages within",

    "A modern web application will be reliant on several different", 
    "programming languages.\n\nThese languages can be broken up in two", 
    "flavours. These are client-side languages (such as those that run in", 
    "the browser -- like JavaScript) and server-side languages (which are", 
    "executed by the server -- like ASP, PHP, JSP, etc.) to form the", 
    "dynamic pages (client-side code) that are then sent to the client.", 
    "Because all server side code should be executed by the server, it", 
    "should never be seen by the client. However in some scenarios, it is", 
    "possible that:\n\n",
    "1. The server side code has syntax errors and therefore is not executed",
    "by the server but is instead sent to the client\n", 
    "2. Using crafted requests it is possible to force the server", 
    "into displaying the source code of the application without executing it.", 
    "\n\n",
    "As the server-side source code often contains sensitive", 
    "information, such as database connection strings or details into the", 
    "application workflow, this can be extremely risky.\n\nCyber-criminals", 
    "will attempt to discover pages that either accidentally or forcefully", 
    "allow the server-side source code to be disclosed, to assist in", 
    "discovering further vulnerabilities or sensitive information.\n\nThe tool", 
    "has detected server-side source code within the server's response.", 
    "_(False positives may occur when requesting binary files such as", 
    "images (.JPG or .PNG) and may require manual verification.)_"
